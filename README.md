# ES6-Node.js-Professional-README-Generator

## Description of the Assignment

The application was reated using node.js to generate a professional README.md file with use of the command line interface. This technique is highly beneficial for developers as it reduces the amount of time it may take developer to write code and allows for them to devote most of their time creating, maintaining and updating applications. 
By the use of inquirer (node package manager) this application takes the user through a series of prompts, asking them their name, title of their application, application description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, what type of license they want their application to be covered under, as well as their GitHub handle, and primary email. Once all prompts are answered, the application generates a professional README.md markdown file with the users inputs.
 The application helped me learn alot with regards to backend technology such as node.js and allowed me to have a greater understanding of how back end developers use this technology to problem solve without the use of user interface or a live browser.

## Technologues Used

This project is powered by Node.js v16, and utilizes the inquirer v8.2.4 (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager).

## Installation 

Clone the repo: git clone 

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Using the terminal, install node.js v16. 

Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package where project files will be stored.

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer.

To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.
